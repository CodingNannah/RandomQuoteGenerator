## Purpose
Practice JS with a random quote generator

## What I changed + (helpful references)
1. Moved the button above the paragraph section. It kept flipping around.
2. I don't know enough JS to know if what was used is the BEST option.

## Future project expansion ideas
1. Verify the JS is the BEST option, or improve upon it.
2. Center the body
3. Change the quote margins to look neater
4. Make the author's name appear below the quote
5. Create different buttons to generate inspirational vs humorous quotes
